# History of Lawrence, Nebraska and St. Stephen’s Catholic Church

## Founding and Early Development

Lawrence, Nebraska, a small village in Nuckolls County, traces its origins to the expansion of the **Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad** in the 1880s[^1]. Officially platted in 1886, Lawrence developed rapidly as a rail workers’ camp and soon became a hub for local agriculture and trade[^1]. Immigrants, particularly of **German and Czech** descent, were among the earliest settlers, bringing strong religious and family-oriented traditions.

By 1890, Lawrence was incorporated and established its first schools, churches, and businesses, including a local newspaper. The fertile plains of southeastern Nebraska proved ideal for farming, with corn, wheat, and livestock forming the foundation of the local economy[^2].

## The Growth of Community and Faith

By the early 20th century, Lawrence had grown to a bustling town of over 500 residents[^3]. It supported multiple churches, including **Sacred Heart Catholic Church**, established in 1893. South of the town, **St. Stephen’s Catholic Church** had already served farm families since its founding in 1875[^4]. This rural parish began with services held in a sod dugout and quickly grew into a strong and enduring congregation.

The churches became focal points not only for religious life but also for **community cohesion**, with events, schools, and volunteer organizations playing a prominent role. Sacred Heart and St. Stephen’s both operated Catholic grade schools, reinforcing the tight-knit, faith-based values of the area.

## The Witte Family and Other Prominent Local Names

Among the prominent multi-generational families in the Lawrence area was the **Witte family**, with deep ties to both the agricultural and religious life of the region. **Clement and Elizabeth Witte**, and their eleven children, were known for their strong involvement in the community[^5]. Baptisms, weddings, and funerals across generations took place at Sacred Heart and St. Stephen’s Churches, documenting their longstanding local presence.

The Witte family exemplified the pattern of land being passed down through generations, contributing to the area's cultural continuity. Other well-known families include the **Kathman, Ostdiek, Schroer**, and **Rempe** families—many interlinked through marriage and shared traditions.

## Mid-20th Century Transitions

The 1930s to 1970s brought major transitions. The **Great Depression** and **World War II** reduced the rural population and challenged family farms. Nonetheless, Lawrence residents continued to support each other through informal cooperation and deep community ties[^6].

St. Stephen’s built a new brick church in 1947 to replace the aging wooden structure[^4]. In 1960, a new school building was constructed, reflecting ongoing investment in education and parish life. However, by 1983, **St. Stephen’s School closed** due to declining enrollment and merged with Sacred Heart's parish education programs.

St. Stephen’s was later designated a mission church, served by the same priest as Sacred Heart. Despite these changes, **parishioner loyalty remained strong**, and the church continued to host significant events, most notably its annual picnic.

## The Annual St. Stephen’s Picnic

A beloved tradition, the **St. Stephen’s Parish Picnic** has been held annually for generations. Drawing attendees from across the state, the picnic includes an outdoor Mass, traditional foods (like fried chicken, ham, and homemade kolaches), children’s games, raffles, and bingo[^7].

It is more than a fundraiser—it’s a **homecoming event** for families and a marker of community identity. Even after the church’s downgrade to mission status, the picnic endured as a celebration of heritage, faith, and fellowship. As one local remarked, “We would often meet [friends] there,” underscoring the event’s role in maintaining intergenerational bonds.

## Modern Lawrence

In 2020, Lawrence had a population of just 272[^3]. The railroad has long since ceased operation, and many local businesses have closed or consolidated. Nevertheless, the community persists. Lawrence is described by locals as “a small town with a big heart,” and traditions such as the St. Stephen’s picnic, church festivals, and school reunions sustain its social fabric.

The **Catholic Church remains central**, with Sacred Heart hosting most weekly services and continuing religious education. The Witte family and many others continue to farm or maintain ties to the land, preserving a deep sense of place and legacy.

## Conclusion

Lawrence, Nebraska stands as a testament to **rural resilience, faith, and family tradition**. Through churches, schools, and the enduring bonds of families like the Wittes, the village has weathered economic and demographic shifts while holding onto the values that built it.
