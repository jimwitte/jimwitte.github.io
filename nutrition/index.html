<h1>Nutrition Advice</h1>

In today's world, we are surrounded by an abundance of processed foods designed for long shelf life, affordability, and taste appeal. Often, health-related terms like "low fat," "heart healthy," or "organic" are used more as marketing tools than genuine health indicators. The production of these foods is largely driven by consumer demand.

It's a noticeable trend in Western societies for individuals to gradually gain weight as they age, increasing risks for various health issues such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, certain cancers, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. Actively maintaining a healthy weight is crucial, and it's important to recognize that weight gain is not an inevitable part of aging, but rather a byproduct of modern food systems.
