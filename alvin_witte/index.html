	Alvin received a football scholarship to attend Hastings College in Nebraska and played for the Broncos during his freshman year. However, he inadvertently lost his athletic eligibility after receiving a low grade in Spanish, which he did not realize would affect his eligibility. While pursuing his studies, Alvin worked night shifts at Metz Bakery and took a semester off to contribute to the construction of Interstate 80. He successfully completed his education at Hastings College, graduating in May 1965 with a Bachelor's degree in English and a minor in History. Later, he pursued advanced studies towards a Master's degree at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
